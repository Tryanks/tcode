# gpui-ios

`gpui-ios` is the UIKit platform backend for `gpui-pre` 0.3.3 used by the
tcode iOS host. It is deliberately an embedded backend: `UIApplication` owns
the process and run loop, Swift supplies a `UIView`, and
`Application::run_embedded` keeps GPUI alive while UIKit drives frames and
input.

The public Rust entry point is:

```rust
pub fn platform() -> Rc<dyn gpui::Platform>
```

It is process-wide, lazily initialized, and must be called on the UIKit main
thread. On non-iOS targets the crate still compiles; calling `platform()`
panics with a platform-specific diagnostic.

## Architecture

The Swift host creates a `GPUIHostView` whose backing layer is
`CAMetalLayer`, then passes the unretained `UIView` pointer and its logical
geometry through `gpui_ios_attach_view`. `IosWindow` wraps that pointer in
`raw-window-handle`'s UIKit handle, creates a Metal-only `wgpu::Instance`, and
hands its context to the published `gpui-pre-wgpu::WgpuRenderer`. Logical
resizes are converted to device pixels before `update_drawable_size`. The
UIKit content scale is also applied to the renderer at creation, on every
scale change, and immediately after a detached surface is replaced so glass
blur, thickness, refraction, and edge widths remain point-correct.

UIKit and GPUI both enter window/application state only on the main thread.
The process-wide platform, attached view, and active window are therefore
thread-local rather than marked `Send`. `IosDispatcher` sends foreground work
to the GCD main queue, background work to GCD global queues selected by GPUI
priority, delayed work through `dispatch_after_f`, and realtime work to a
named Rust thread. `CADisplayLink` calls `gpui_ios_request_frame` so animations,
touch gesture deadlines, and fling momentum keep advancing.

The host is a universal iPhone/iPad app. iPhone supports portrait and both
landscapes; iPad additionally supports upside-down portrait. During rotation,
UIKit forwards the new safe-area and keyboard cover before the new logical
bounds, then `IosWindow` resizes the renderer's drawable and notifies GPUI's
window-bounds observer. Rotation therefore crosses the shared responsive
breakpoint without rebuilding the shell or its state.

`IosTextSystem` uses CoreText for shaping and `zed-font-kit`'s CoreText loader
for metrics and rasterization. The default family is
`.AppleSystemUIFont`; CoreText's cascade supplies PingFang for Chinese and
Apple Color Emoji where needed. CoreText UTF-16 run indices are converted back
to the UTF-8 byte indices expected by GPUI.

Unsafe code and all C/Objective-C-facing state are confined to `src/ios/`.
Swift retains every UIKit object; Rust keeps only a non-owning pointer for the
lifetime of the attached platform window.

## Host boundary

The forward ABI declarations live in
[BridgingHeader.h](../../ios/host/Sources/BridgingHeader.h); the Rust exports
are in [ffi.rs](src/ios/ffi.rs). The Swift host implements the reverse callbacks
in [HostCallbacks.swift](../../ios/host/Sources/HostCallbacks.swift), including
frame scheduling, keyboard presentation, input configuration, clipboard and URL
opening. Keep declarations synchronized when changing that boundary. Callbacks
copy transient byte buffers synchronously; UIKit objects remain Swift-owned.

## Touch and scrolling behavior

The host assigns a monotonically increasing `TouchId` when each `UITouch`
begins and sends all changed contacts in a single C array. Rust emits one raw
`PlatformInput::Touch` per contact. For moves, UIKit's last predicted touch is
included for latency compensation, while actual coordinates remain the source
of hit testing and velocity.

`gpui-pre` 0.3.3 contains the gesture arena, so this backend intentionally does
not also synthesize mouse events. GPUI selects the primary touch, defers the
mouse-down/up click pair until the tap wins, emits drag scrolling as
`ScrollWheelEvent { delta: ScrollDelta::Pixels(..) }`, advances iOS-style fling
momentum on later frames, and preserves its own long-press deadline. A second
touch can therefore participate in GPUI's multi-touch recognition without
creating a second mouse pointer, and small movements do not break click or
long-press timing. The backend supplies touch events and platform tuning; application components
choose which gestures to handle. The same portable arena serves Android.

## Keyboard bridge

The Swift host keeps a nearly transparent `UITextView` in the view hierarchy.
When GPUI reports text focus, it becomes first responder. Marked text is sent
through `replace_and_mark_text_in_range`; a confirmed Chinese candidate is
sent through `replace_text_in_range`, which replaces the marked range and
commits the composition. Text assistance and return-key presentation are
updated from `TextInputConfiguration`. Keyboard frame notifications update
`WindowInsets::ime`, while `safeAreaInsets` update `WindowInsets::safe_area`.

## Build and run

From the repository root, with Xcode, XcodeGen and the corresponding Rust target
installed:

```sh
crates/ios/host/build.sh --simulator
crates/ios/host/build.sh --device
```

The script builds `tcode-ios`, copies `libtcode_ios.a` into the ignored host
`lib/` directory, generates `Tcode.xcodeproj`, and builds the Debug `Tcode`
scheme. The simulator destination defaults to iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5; set
`TCODE_IOS_SIMULATOR_OS` for another installed runtime. Set
`TCODE_IOS_RUST_PROFILE=release` for an optimized Rust library; the Xcode host
configuration remains Debug. Device builds are unsigned and need signing and
provisioning before installation.

The simulator app is written to
`crates/ios/host/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Tcode.app`:

```sh
xcrun simctl install booted crates/ios/host/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Tcode.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.tryanks.tcode
```

See [the design spec](../../../docs/DESIGN.md#compact-layout) for application behavior and
platform verification, and [remote work mode](../../../docs/remote.md) for
pairing with a host.

## Current limitations

- One attached UIKit view and one GPUI window are supported. Native secondary
  windows, dialogs, menus, drag-and-drop, screen capture, and cursor APIs are
  not implemented.
- GPUI credential APIs return an unsupported error. tcode pairing persistence
  belongs to the application host, not this platform backend.
- IME candidate-window caret positioning and continuous interpolation of the
  keyboard animation are not yet implemented; endpoint insets are exact.
- Custom CoreText feature dictionaries and explicit fallback lists are retained
  in font cache keys but are not yet applied to attributed runs.
- Accessibility is limited to GPUI semantics that UIKit can observe indirectly;
  there is no native UIKit accessibility-tree adapter yet.
- The display abstraction currently describes the attached main screen only.

## Attribution

The module boundaries and host/backend handshake were informed by the
ISC-licensed `gpui-toolkit/crates/gpui-ios` reference supplied with this
worktree. This implementation was written for the different `gpui-pre` 0.3.3
traits and renderer APIs; no reference source was vendored or copied into this
crate.

## Scroll target ownership

Both mobile backends use GPUI's private gesture recognizer and scroll dispatch.
See the [shared scroll ownership constraints](../gpui-android/README.md#scroll-target-ownership)
for the distinction between its existing touch-down coordinate anchor and stable
element capture. tcode's UI capture listener intercepts recognized scroll events while preserving
UIKit's actual and predicted coordinates and GPUI's gesture recognition.
