//! Persistence for tcode threads.
//!
//! Projects, thread metadata and every thread's event log live in one Turso
//! database, `tcode.db`, in the data dir ([`data_dir`]):
//!   * `projects` and `sessions` hold each [`Project`] / [`SessionMeta`] as the
//!     JSON serde produces for it.
//!   * `events` holds each thread's log as raw byte segments, one per line
//!     including its `\n`, densely numbered from 0: the bytes of a `{ ts, event }`
//!     record, or whatever a migrated or imported log contained. A turn-changes
//!     snapshot that a later one supersedes is kept without its diffs
//!     ([`tcode_core::session::TurnSnapshots`]).
//!   * `diff_pass` names the threads whose superseded snapshots
//!     [`SessionStore::drop_superseded_diffs`] has dealt with.
//!   * `turn_index` holds a thread's [`TurnIndex`], while the host knows it.
//!   * `kept_worktrees` holds the path of every worktree whose thread was
//!     deleted with the worktree kept.
//!
//! Model and command caches stay as JSON files beside it.
//!
//! Replay accepts timestamped records and legacy bare [`AgentEvent`] lines,
//! then folds [`StoredEvent`]s into a [`tcode_core::session::Timeline`].
