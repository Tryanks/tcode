//! The window's outer seam and the one layout rule derived from it.
//!
//! A window is not always the rectangle it reports: a status bar, a notch, a
//! home indicator or a software keyboard can cover part of it. Those edges are
//! a property of the *window*, not of the host the workspace is attached to,
//! so they are deliberately not part of `ClientHost` — and they are owned by
//! GPUI, not by this crate. [`Window::fully_visible_bounds`] is the viewport
//! intersected with the platform's visual viewport and inset by
//! `WindowInsets::effective()`, and GPUI refreshes the window whenever either
//! changes. Everything here is a pure function over that window and the kind
//! of build reading it, evaluated where it is consumed: nothing is cached or
//! polled.
