//! In-process MCP server exposing the embedded preview browser to the agent.
//!
//! The GUI process owns a native WebView (see `src/ui/preview_panel.rs`). The
//! agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) are separate child processes; to let them
//! drive that WebView we run a small [Model Context Protocol] server over
//! **streamable HTTP** on `127.0.0.1:<random port>`, guarded by a bearer token,
//! and register it with each spawned agent.
//!
//! A tool call arrives on the tokio HTTP runtime, is turned into a
//! [`PreviewOp`], and handed to the UI process through the [`Broker`]: a
//! request rides an [`async_channel`] into the gpui main thread, which resolves
//! it against the live WebView (running JS via `evaluate_script`, or shelling
//! out to `screencapture`) and answers on a per-request reply channel. This
//! mirrors T3's `PreviewAutomationBroker` request→deferred→respond pattern,
//! reduced to what a single native WebView can do without CDP.
//!
//! [Model Context Protocol]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io
