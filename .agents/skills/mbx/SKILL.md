# mbx: the shared Rust build cache

mbx (mr_boxington) shares compiled work across every checkout and worktree on
the machine and prunes its own storage. A cargo command that runs through mbx
hits that cache; plain cargo builds a private, unmanaged `target/` of
25–35 GB per worktree and shares nothing.

## Detect

Run `mbx doctor`. If the command is missing, mbx is not installed: use cargo
as usual and stop here. If it reports `Cargo shim is not installed` or the
shell cannot run the mise shim (sandboxed agents commonly see this), the
explicit form below still works.

## Use

- Prefix every cargo command: `mbx cargo build --release -p tcode --locked`,
  `mbx cargo nextest run --workspace --locked`, `mbx cargo clippy ...`,
  `mbx cargo run ...`. The arguments are unchanged.
- When `mbx` is not on PATH inside a sandbox, call the binary mise installed:
  `$(mise where mr-boxington)/.mise-bins/mbx cargo <args>` (on this machine
  `~/.local/share/mise/installs/mr-boxington/latest/.mise-bins/mbx`).
- A worktree whose `target/` is a symlink into `~/Library/Caches/mbx/targets`
  is managed. A plain `target/` directory was built by raw cargo: run
  `mbx adopt` in that worktree once, then continue through mbx.
- Build jobs need no limit for cache reasons; a cold build through mbx is
  mostly cache hits once any checkout has built the same dependencies.

## Disk

`mbx stats` shows the cache; `mbx gc --dry-run` shows what pruning would
remove; `mbx clean` drops one worktree's managed target. Delete a finished
worktree's `target/` before removing the worktree so mbx does not keep an
orphaned managed target around.
